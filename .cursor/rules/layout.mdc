# Layout Specification

## Overall Structure

- Multipage website using a shared layout shell (`Layout` component).
- All pages share the same header (navbar) and footer.
- Pages are routed with standard navigation:
  - `/` → Home
  - `/team` → Team
  - `/projects` → Projects
  - `/vision` → Vision
  - `/contact` → Contact

- Responsive behavior is required (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)

## Section Spacing and Alignment

- Each major section within a page should be separated by `py-16`
- Headings are top-aligned (`text-3xl` or `text-4xl`, bold)
- Text content is left-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile
- Use grid/flex layouts for section blocks (e.g., grid of cards)

## Responsiveness

- All layout and components must be responsive:
  - Mobile-first using Tailwind
  - Grid-based layouts collapse to vertical on small screens
  - Font sizes and spacing scale with breakpoints

## Scroll Behavior

- Smooth scroll enabled
- Optional: animated reveal on scroll using Framer Motion
- Navigation links in navbar should scroll to top or anchor cleanly
