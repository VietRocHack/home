# FunThingsView Component

## Overview
The `FunThingsView` component displays a grid of fun/meme images from the team's journey, providing a lighthearted complement to the more formal hackathon photos in the journey gallery.

## Component Structure

```tsx
interface FunThingsViewProps {
  memes: Meme[];
  getImagePath: (path: string) => string;
  onMemeClick: (index: number) => void;
}
```

- **memes**: Array of meme objects from the data store
- **getImagePath**: Function to format image paths correctly, supporting both local paths and CDN URLs
- **onMemeClick**: Callback function when a meme is clicked

## Visual Design

### Layout
- **Header**: Centered title and description
- **Grid**: Responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)
- **Cards**: Each meme displayed in a card with:
  - Square image container
  - Caption/title area
  - Date and context information
  - Tag list with highlighted tags

### Styling
- Uses dark card backgrounds (`bg-gray-900`) with image hover effects
- Image containers maintain square aspect ratio with object-cover fitting
- Tags use yellow backgrounds with black text for visibility
- Implements Framer Motion animations for:
  - Initial fade-in of grid
  - Staggered appearance of items
  - Scale effect on hover

## Integration
- Used as one of the view modes in the `HackathonJourneyGallery` component
- Displays when the viewMode is set to 'fun'
- Works with the corresponding `MemeLightbox` for detailed viewing

## Data Source
- Pulls data from meme.json via dataUtils.ts
- Supports filtering and sorting through parent component
- Supports images hosted either locally or on a CDN (full URLs)
