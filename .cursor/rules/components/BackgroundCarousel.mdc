# BackgroundCarousel

- Visual style: Fullscreen background with semi-transparent overlay
- Image sources:
  - Dynamically loaded from hackathons.json photos array
  - Special image ('/team/bitcamp_2025/demo_team_pic.jpg') prioritized by appearing first
- Behavior:
  - Randomly selects next image rather than sequential display
  - Tracks previous image to prevent showing the same image consecutively
  - Synchronized with logo changes through custom event
- Animation:
  - Smooth fade transitions between images (1000ms duration)
  - 40% opacity when fully visible to maintain content readability
- Implementation:
  - Uses Next.js Image component with fill and object-cover
  - 8-second automatic rotation interval
  - Fallback dark background when no images are available
