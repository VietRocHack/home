We were pretty hyped for this one, since we won CalHacks, the biggest hackathon of the season, and there should be no problem for us to win this second biggest one, right? WRONG! We fumbled from the idea to the execution, but on the bright side, we met some really friendly ngÆ°á»i Viá»t there, and we made some good friends (one of them even joined Hoang for Meta internship). That was our steepest lost, but we had steak afterwards, so it was not that bad.",

However, we decided to do this one just for the good old days, so we head back to the Free State of Maryland. Surprisingly, we won an award and we got our messages delivered to one of our long-term group meme. All is good!",
