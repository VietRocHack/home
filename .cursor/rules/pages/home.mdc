# Home Page Rules for VietRocHack

GOAL
Implement the homepage of vietrochack.com using a clean, modern layout with a touch of dry humor. The theme is dark-mode only, with the Space Grotesk font. The page should feel professional but subtly self-aware, appealing to developers and hackathon enthusiasts.

LAYOUT STRUCTURE

 1. Splash / Rotating Logo Section
- Fullscreen section that appears on page load.
- Centered giant logo text: `VietRocHack`.
- The text should cycle through a list of variations every 3–5 seconds, such as:
  - VietTravelHack
  - VietSleepHack
  - VietReactHack
  - VietWhyHack
  - Viet404Hack
- Use a crossfade or typewriter effect for transitions.
- Subtitle below logo:  
  "Vietnamese hackers from the University of Rochester. Some of this site is real."
- Styling: large heading (`text-7xl`), centered, Space Grotesk, dark background.

 2. Hero Section
- Title: `We’re VietRocHack.`
- Subtitle: `We build apps. Win hackathons. And sometimes get sleep.`
- Two buttons:
  - `Explore Projects` → link to `/projects`
  - `Meet the Team` → link to `/team`
- Design: centered layout, subtle fade/slide animation on load, buttons with accent colors and hover effects.

 3. Featured Projects Section
- Heading: `A few things we’re not totally embarrassed to show:`
- Display 1–2 highlighted projects.
- Each card should include:
  - Project title
  - 2-line summary
  - Stack tags
  - Buttons: GitHub, Demo
- Use deadpan humor in project blurbs. Keep the styling clean and card-based.

 4. Team Strip Section
- Heading: `Four devs. Two time zones. One shared Google Doc.`
- Display a horizontal row of team photos from past hackathons.
- On hover, show captions like:
  - "Vuong debugging via prayer"
  - "One hour before the demo crash"
- Keep photos slightly grayscale by default, and color on hover.

 5. Stats Section
- 2x2 grid of animated stats.
- Each includes a title, a number (animated count), and a dry subtext.
  - Example:
    - Hackathons Entered: `7` → "And survived most of them"
    - Bugs Denied: `All` → "They're features"
- Style should be clean and minimal, using a dark grid with white or light text.

INTERACTION DETAILS
- Use Framer Motion or similar for animations (fade in, typewriter effect, hover transitions).
- The rotating logo should be implemented with `setInterval` or equivalent in React to cycle through the names list.
- Ensure the hero content does not shift unexpectedly as the logo cycles.
