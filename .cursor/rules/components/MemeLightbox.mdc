# MemeLightbox Component

## Overview
The `MemeLightbox` component provides a fullscreen modal view for displaying and navigating through meme images when selected from the FunThingsView grid.

## Component Structure

```tsx
interface MemeLightboxProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  meme: Meme | null;
  memes: Meme[];
  isFullscreen: boolean;
  getImagePath: (path: string) => string;
  onClose: () => void;
  onToggleFullscreen: () => void;
  onPrevious: () => void;
  onNext: () => void;
}
```

- **isOpen**: Boolean to control visibility of the lightbox
- **meme**: Currently selected meme to display
- **memes**: Complete array of memes for navigation
- **isFullscreen**: Toggle for expanded fullscreen view
- **getImagePath**: Function to format image paths
- **onClose**: Callback to close the lightbox
- **onToggleFullscreen**: Callback to toggle fullscreen mode
- **onPrevious/onNext**: Navigation callbacks

## Visual Design

### Layout
- **Modal**: Fixed position overlay with semi-transparent background
- **Container**: Centered content container with responsive sizing
- **Image**: Large display of current meme with object-contain fitting
- **Caption Area**: Information panel with meme details
- **Controls**:
  - Navigation arrows for previous/next
  - Close button
  - Fullscreen toggle button
  - Count indicator showing current position

### Styling
- Dark theme with black/semi-transparent backgrounds
- Consistent UI controls with hover effects
- Shows photo count and position indicators
- Tags use yellow backgrounds with black text for visibility
- Implements Framer Motion animations for transitions

## Interaction
- Clicking outside the image area closes the lightbox
- Support for fullscreen toggle
- Left and right navigation between memes
- Displays context, date, and tag information

## Integration
- Used as a companion to the `FunThingsView` component
- Triggered when a meme is clicked in the grid view
- Shares styling approach with `PhotoLightbox` but optimized for meme content
